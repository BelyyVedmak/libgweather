libgweather 2.21.1
==================

This is the first release of libgweather as a standalone
library. libgweather provides access to weather information from the
net and is used by programs such as the weather report applet.

The library was previously part of the gnome-applets package and this
release corresponds with the 2.21.3 release of gnome-applets. Since
the last release of gnome-applets, the following changes have been
made to libgweather:

 - Locations.xml has been moved from gweather to libgweather and a
   pkg-config variable has been added to let applications find it.
 - Units are now marked for translation.
 - New functions to parse temperatures and wind speeds.
 - Locations.xml fixes.
